MonetDB/Postgres-Comparision
This script runs a TPC-H benchmark on MonetDB, PostgreSQL, MariaDB and CitusDB. It also supports the installation of these databases from source, test data generation using the TPC-H data generator, and the loading of the data from CSV into the databases. The script was developed on Fedora 20, it should work there and need no root privileges except for dropping fs caches.
